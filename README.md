# Churn-Prediction

## Dataset
This is a dataset from a telecom company, of their customers. Based on various features of these customers and their calling plans, we want to predict if a customer is likely to leave the company. This is expensive for the company, as a lost customer means lost monthly revenue!


Telecom company was losing its customers provided its users' dataset. I applied various ML algorithms, ROC curve and confusion matrix to identify users who will churn and what minimum offer to give them so they don't churn and company stays in profit.
